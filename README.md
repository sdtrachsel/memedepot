## Context ðŸ”¨ 

The Meme Depot was a partnered project build during the collaborators' third semester enrolled in [Turing School of Software & Design's Front End Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four-semester, eight-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The project was built to match the specifications of our [project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html), and represents our first TypeScript application. In addition to challenging us to tackle a new syntax, different conventions, and lots of self-teaching, The Meme Depot also required us to incorporate the following languages, technologies, and competencies: 
  * React 
  * Test-Driven Development utilizing the Cypress framework
  * URL customization and browser compatibility via Router 
  * Network requests & API data 
  * Git workflow
  * [Vercel](https://memedepot.vercel.app/)
  * [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/sdtrachsel/projects/3/views/1)

## Goals and Challenges ðŸ”¨ 
For this project, our group was asked to choose a new skill to learn independently, without help or guidance from our Turing instructors. We collectively chose TypeScript, interested in its implications for preventing and pinpointing errors, as well as its growing popularity in tech spaces. Our group found the process of tackling TypeScript to be both challenging and rewarding-- learning to translate our understanding of traditional, relaxed JavaScript into this strict, type-annotated JavaScript was done strictly outside of the classroom, requiring each collaborator to flex their self-teaching muscles. This meant a lot of quality time spent with the [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs), the [React TypeScript CheatSheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets), and [Mosh Hamedani's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjN00cM18Z4&list=PLTjRvDozrdlxJjrQ4phZAUmiRn-HbK3M_) YouTube TypeScript tutorial.

While this was our first foray into the world of TypeScript, React is still relatively new for all of us, as are Cypress, Router, and Vercel. Because our learning of TypeScript went hand-in-hand with our continued learning of these other technologies, we often needed to carefully read documentation, practice smart Googling, and occasionally reach out to our classmates and mentors to bring The Meme Depot into full bloom. 

## Future Development Opportunities ðŸ”¨ 
In order to fully dedicate our time and sanity to learning TypeScript, we opted to keep The Meme Depot relatively simple in functionality but extremely solid in architecture. Given additional time for development, the collaborators would look forward to implementing download functionality, user log-in and authentification, or a custom back-end server to host images, jokes, and completed memes.
